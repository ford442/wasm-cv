This week:

- The meaning(lessness) of C++ scope in a wasm project, crossing the boundary and the 
  difficulty of managing memory

- Software design for wasm projects: Avoiding frequent data transactions with the 90/10 philosophy

- Inline javascript: Calling a C++ function from javascript from within a C++ function

- Moving the main loop to C++ and refactoring functions to return memory-managed objects
